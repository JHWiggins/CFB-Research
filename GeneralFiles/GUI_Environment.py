	# Should automatically track the play number, posession number, the number of plays per possesion, and the score at the time of 	  the play
	# Environment should be dynamic enough for it to change as the inputs are put into the system i.e. what follows a pass play input 	    should be different than a run play input
	# This environment should include a mixture of drop down menus and inout boxes
	# Each should start with the input of the game rosters in order to allow for positions per play to be input quickly
	# OR THE ROSTER COULD BE NATIVELY SAVED FROM THE START OF THE SEASON WITH PLAYER OBJECTS IN ORDER TO SAVE PLAYER BY PLAYER STATS
	
	# FIRST GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY ALL VARIABLES THAT WILL BE ENTERED
