   Well its been a long time coming but I am finally putting one of these out. This is a full game review both from a statistical and practical view. This process will be done through a play by play data input including all stats and formations/plays that are run in the game's entirety. A printer friendly version will be included for download that has the entire play by play included, for the blog only key plays such as scores, turnovers, or explosive plays will be incorperated. Since this is the inaugural post, I guess I should introduce myself, y'all can call me u/JHWiggins I'm a current senior, about to be fifth year, at Mississippi State University. I grew up in the suburbs of New York City so as you can imagine college football wasn't huge outside of my family. My other teams I do have a soft spot for are Army as I grew up watching them in person, and USC as I grew up watching them on tv (dad's from SoCal).

   I plan on taking the most interesting or the biggest upset of the week and doing one of these blog's on it. Now because I'm a homer, for rivalry weekend, I will be doing two blogs, one for the egg bowl and one other game just for fairness sake. Now this is all subject to change as time goes on, but the plan is to always make the analysis **at least** this indepth if not more. I will try my best to put these out as frequently as possible, but with school and having to find game film I can't make too many promises for now on that front.
